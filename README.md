# vscode-settings

## Intro
I'm just at the beginning of my codeing journey and it can feel a little overwhelming trying to get to grips with learning new languages, problem solving techniques and trying to get your head around which tools to use. So when it came to setting up my MAC and coding environment I went straight to youTube for some inspiaration. There is a lot of great content out there but I have to give a special mention to CJ from [Syntax.](https://syntax.fm/) and his youTube video [Set up a MAC in 2024 for Power users and Developers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK7zLYAXdDs&t=7s). 

As I progress with my journey, I will come back here and update my settings and hopefully provide some commentary on what tools I use and why I use them.
